● A short description of your troubleshooting process.
	- used the redis-cli ping command and  ps auxw| grep redis-ser command to verify whether the redis-server is running or not
	- tried to start the redis-server with the command systemctl status redis-server.service
	- looked at the error in the systemctl status redis-server.service and journalctl.exe
	- Tried to start the manually using redis-server and /usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf
		- sucessfully able to start the server manually
	- Changed the permissions of log file and /var/log/redis/redis-server.log and started the service again but failed
	- validated the /etc/systemd/system/redis.service and confirmed the systemctl is enabled
	- validated the /etc/redis/redis.conf
	- compared the /etc/systemd/system/redis.service and /etc/redis/redis.conf and found the issue
● Tell us what's wrong
	- The ReadWriteDirectories in /etc/systemd/system/redis.service is pointed towards -/var/log/redis but the log file in /etc/redis/redis.conf is pointed to /var/log/redis-server.log
● Explain what you did to fix it
	- Modified the /etc/redis/redis.conf file and changed the logging file to /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
